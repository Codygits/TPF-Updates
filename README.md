### The Phoenix Flavour requires Skyrim: Special Edition (SE)

Currently Fishing & Rare Curios are the only free CC content that's integrated into the list. The downgrader is no longer necessary to use, just have a unmodified Skyrim SE install by verifying the integrity of the game files by following these [instructions](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB). Make sure that the game is set to English in Steam. Non-English versions of the game are not supported.

### Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019

Scrambled Bugs now requires [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe), make sure you have the file mentioned here installed for the list to operate correctly


# Installation
- To install The Phoenix Flavour with Wabbajack, [follow these instructions](https://github.com/Codygits/TPF-Updates/blob/main/List%20Installation.md).

Note that TPF does not yet support any of the Anniversary Edition content yet. LOOT is similarly not supported, there are no custom LOOT rules and you should under no circumstances run LOOT on your TPF installation.

## Playing TPF

It is not possible to run modded Skyrim through Steam. You must always start the game by running SKSE through Mod Organizer 2. Note that I renamed the SKSE executable to The Phoenix Flavour and changed the icon for it as well.

- Open your installation folder and double-click the ModOrganizer.exe inside.
- In Mod Organizer 2, make sure The Phoenix Flavour is selected as executable.
- Hit Run to start the game. Select NEW in the main menu.

## Difficulty Modifiers and Optionals 

By default there are (3) mods enabled to make combat easier / more akin to vanilla. If you wish to increase the difficulty of the list disable the Blade and Blunt and the two Dragon War Mods in this section.

## Performance Options
The Phoenix Flavour comes with a pre-build performance profile for less powerful PC's. Switching to the profile is as easy as just selecting it from the drop down Profile menu as indicated below...

If the performance profile is not enough, disabling the ENB thats enabled by default can be turned off. Un-check the mod **ENBSeries v0.475** under the seperator ***DIFFICULTY MODIFIERS & OPTIONALS***.

## Skip the Intro
The Phoenix Flavour comes with Optional Quick Start SE which is disabled by default, if you wish to skip the intro cutscene just enable the (2) mods in the picture below.

## Widescreen Support
Widescreen support is a matter of enabling all the mods under the **Widescreen Support** seperator near the bottom of the left hand side of Mod Organizer 2.

## MCM Configuration

Once in game you're good to go, all of the MCM options have been pre-configured.
