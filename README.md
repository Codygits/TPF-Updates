# Requirements
### The Phoenix Flavour requires Skyrim: Special Edition (SE)

**Wabbajack modlists are not compatible with Skyrim Anniversary Edition** and there is no estimated timeframe for when this may change.

The Anniversary Edition makes a number of fundamental changes which mean many critical tools, such as SKSE and mods that rely on those tools, need to be updated.

In order to use Wabbajack modlists, you must not update your copy of Skyrim Special Edition. If you updated, use the AE downgrade patcher by downloading the "FullPatcher.exe":

To prevent your game updating, change Skyrim SE's update settings in Steam to only update when launched. Never launch Skyrim SE via Steam, only via your mod manager or skse64_loader.

**Please do not ask when AE will be supported**.
### .NET 5.0 Runtime

With the Scrambled Bugs update requiring .Net 5.0, the game will not launch without this being installed. Please ensure you have .NET v5.0 installed. Download the desktop and console x64 app installers from Microsoft here: [Download .NET 5.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime).


# Installation
- To install The Phoenix Flavour with Wabbajack, [follow these instructions](https://github.com/Codygits/TPF-Updates/blob/main/List%20Installation.md).

Note that TPF does not support Creation Club content. LOOT is similarly not supported, there are no custom LOOT rules and you should under no circumstances run LOOT on your TPF installation.

## Playing TPF

It is not possible to run modded Skyrim through Steam. You must always start the game by running SKSE through Mod Organizer 2. Note that I renamed the SKSE executable to The Phoenix Flavour and changed the icon for it as well.

- Open your installation folder and double-click the ModOrganizer.exe inside.
- In Mod Organizer 2, make sure The Phoenix Flavour is selected as executable.
- Hit Run to start the game. Select NEW in the main menu.

## MCM Configuration

Once in game you're good to go, all of the MCM options have been pre-configured.
