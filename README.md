In the event you have updated to Skyrim: Anniversary Edition (AE) you will need to downgrade to (SE) by using the tool below.

Once you have downgraded or are still on Skyrim Special Edition your good to continue.

## Playing TPF

It is not possible to run modded Skyrim through Steam. You must always start the game by running SKSE through Mod Organizer 2. Note that I renamed the SKSE executable to The Phoenix Flavour and changed the icon for it as well.

- Open your installation folder and double-click the ModOrganizer.exe inside.
- In Mod Organizer 2, make sure The Phoenix Flavour is selected as executable.
- Hit Run to start the game. Select NEW in the main menu.

## MCM Configuration

Once in game the only MCM you have to configure is Simple Smithing (Overhaul) with the following settings...
- In the **Settings** tab, uncheck **Allow Artefact Replication**.
- In the **Settings** tab, uncheck **Allow Upgrade Unique Gear Levels**.
