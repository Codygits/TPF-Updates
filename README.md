# Requirements
### The Phoenix Flavour requires Skyrim: Anniversary Edition (AE) 

None of the Creation Club content has been integrated yet. The downgrader is no longer necessary to use, just have a unmodified Skyrim AE install by verifying the integrity of the game files by following these [instructions](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB). Make sure that the game is set to English in Steam. Non-English versions of the game are not supported.

### .NET 5.0 Runtime

With the Scrambled Bugs update requiring .Net 5.0, the game will not launch without this being installed. Please ensure you have .NET v5.0 installed. Download the desktop and console x64 app installers from Microsoft here: [Download .NET 5.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime).

# Installation
- To install The Phoenix Flavour with Wabbajack, [follow these instructions](https://github.com/Codygits/TPF-Updates/blob/main/List%20Installation.md).

Note that TPF does not support Creation Club content. LOOT is similarly not supported, there are no custom LOOT rules and you should under no circumstances run LOOT on your TPF installation.

## Playing TPF

It is not possible to run modded Skyrim through Steam. You must always start the game by running SKSE through Mod Organizer 2. Note that I renamed the SKSE executable to The Phoenix Flavour and changed the icon for it as well.

- Open your installation folder and double-click the ModOrganizer.exe inside.
- In Mod Organizer 2, make sure The Phoenix Flavour is selected as executable.
- Hit Run to start the game. Select NEW in the main menu.

## MCM Configuration

Once in game you're good to go, all of the MCM options have been pre-configured.
