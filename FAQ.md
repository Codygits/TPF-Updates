Q1. Whats this error and is it a bad crash?

![RBError](https://github.com/Codygits/TPF-Updates/blob/e842605d6ba185d095b38d5fe47381a7e019e115/images/RBError.PNG)

A1. No, this is normal outcome of how [Root Builder](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31720) works. If Mo2 is unlocked before the game is closed out of, you'll receive this error and is save to ignore. It can also happen randomly when exiting the game, due to a game file still in use while its trying to be removed via Root Builder. Most situtations of this error and fine and can be ignored.
