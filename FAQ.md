## Q1. Whats this error and is it a bad crash?

![RBError](https://github.com/Codygits/TPF-Updates/blob/e842605d6ba185d095b38d5fe47381a7e019e115/images/RBError.PNG)

A1. No, this is normal outcome of how [Root Builder](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31720) works. If Mo2 is unlocked before the game is closed out of, you'll receive this error and is save to ignore. It can also happen randomly when exiting the game, due to a game file still in use while its trying to be removed via Root Builder. Most situtations of this error and fine and can be ignored.

## Q2. Mo2's red triangle has a yellow notification on it after I ran the game, is that bad?

![Overwrite2](https://github.com/Codygits/TPF-Updates/blob/ed09ba012e54c414125a0f1011e967b3a43abdda/images/Overwrite2.PNG)

A2. Most likely not. Its normal that the game has some files that get generated the first time you run the game and they get stored into the overwrite folder. They can safely be ignored if you have the notification "There are files in your Overwrite mod dorectory". Do note that if a crash log is generated, it will also get placed into the overwrite and may be worth looking into / posting on the Discord channel #tpf-crash-reports. Crash logs will be in a folder called "NetScriptFramework".
