## 1. Skeletons are unable to wield CC fishing dagger.
They will attempt to unsheath the dagger, but won't be able to and will stand infront of you without attacking. Plan to remove the daggers from their leveled lists in the next update.

## 2. Unable to purchase Honeyside.
For some reason unknown to me the dialogue never shows up to purchase the house from Jarl's Steward, Anuriel. As a temporary fix, if this happens to you, while standing in Riften open the console command with the `` ` `` key and type ```setstage purchasehouse 10```. That should complete the quest to buy the house and move the quest forward.
