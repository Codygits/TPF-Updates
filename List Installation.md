How to install Wabbajack and install any list.

## Wabbajack

Similarly to the vanilla game files, Wabbajack should also not be installed in any UAC protected folders.
- Create a new **Wabbajack** folder.

The Wabbajack app can be downloaded directly from the website:
- Click the **Download** button on the home page of the [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/) site.
- Move the downloaded **Wabbajack.exe** into the folder you previously created.
- Upon launching it, the latest version of Wabbajack will be downloaded into the same directory.

### Choosing the list
Once Wabbajack has launched, you can click the **Browse Modlists** button to view all currently available lists. If you are following these instructions, you likely already know which mod list you want to install.

## List Configuration
Once the meta file for your chosen list has been downloaded, a new browser window with the list’s readme will automatically open. You can simply continue here on this page (if your list supports it to begin with).

Before you can begin installing the list, you need to define some file paths:

### Installation Location
The Installation Location will be the folder in which Mod Organizer 2 and all mods are installed in.

- It should be outside of aforementioned protected folders.
- It should be on the same hard drive as your Skyrim SE installation.
- It should be on your fastest hard drive (ideally an SSD).
- It should be in or near the root of your drive (top-level folder).

For example, with Skyrim SE installed under ```C:\Steam Library\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition```, a good location for the Wabbajack list would be ```C:\Modlist Name\```.

### Download Location

The Download Location will be the folder in which all downloaded mod archives are stored in. It is a sub-folder of your MO2 directory (Installation Location) by default. However, the downloaded archives are only needed for installing and updating the list, not for playing. Therefore, they do not need to be on the same hard drive as the vanilla game and installed mod files, so the 60GB+ of space they take up would be wasted on an SSD. Any HDD is perfectly sufficient to store these archives.

## Installation

Once you have set target folders for the Installation Location and Download Location, the Start button (arrow) to the right of the folder paths will light up. Click it to start the installation of the list. If you have Nexus Premium, simply lean back and wait for the process to be completed. It may take several hours depending on the speed of your internet connection. If you do not have Premium, Wabbajack will prompt you with the mod pages where you have to click the download button manually.

### Troubleshooting 

While Wabbajack runs perfectly fine in most cases, an installation may fail for various reasons. If it does, diagnosing the issue is possible with the logs generated by Wabbajack which you can find within your Wabbajack installation directory in the logs folder: ```\Wabbajack\logs\```. The relevant log will be named ***Wabbajack.current.log*** with older logs being renamed according to the time of their creation.

If Wabbajack fails, please try restarting it first. You will not lose any progress by closing and reopening the app.

If the issue persists, find the Discord support channel for your chosen list (either on the Wabbajack or the list author’s server) and drop the ***Wabbajack.current.log*** with a request for support,

# Launching the Game

Wabbajack lists must always be start with the **Skyrim Script Extender** which in turn must be launched through **Mod Organizer 2**. Remember that your mod list installation directory is simply a Mod Organizer 2 instance.
- Double-click the **ModOrganizer.exe** within your mod list installation directory.

Now you can see the full setup: The mod order is on the left, likely sorted below separators that may be collapsed by default, and the load order with all plugins on the right. Above the load order (in the right pane), you can see the executables drop-down. Skyrim Script Extender is already selected here, so you can start the game by clicking RUN.

**Always run SKSE through MO2 to start the game**. If you launch the game through Steam or directly with the default executables (e.g. SkyrimSE.exe), your mods will not load and the game will simply be vanilla. If you run the default executables through MO2 (instead of the SKSE launcher), many mods will also not work because they require SKSE

# Final

Your Wabbajack list is fully installed at this point. Please return to the list’s original readme for any further instructions and MCM setup.
